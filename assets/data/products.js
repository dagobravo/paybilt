          As payment technology evolves and customers seek new ways to pay, QR Codes are becoming more popular as an alternative solution
          for Merchants to expand their customer's payment options and use their mobile devices to pay.

          How it works?

          Buyers - Just scan, pay, and go. Customers open your app, select 'Scan/Pay' and hold their phone up to the QR code. Then,
          the customer enters the amount and taps 'Send'. Paying with our app means you don't have to handle cash or credit cards when
          you pay in person. All you need to do is scan a seller's QR code when you pay. Sellers - Get set to sell with QR codes. If you're
          about to start your own business, or already up and running, it's easy to accept touch-free payments in-person. Just download and
          display your Paybilt QR code, so your customers can scan it with their app. No need for hardware, software, or a card reader.

          Paybilt offers two QR Code based payment solutions to help both businesses and customers:

          Paybilt Merchant-Presented QR Code (MPQR):
          The merchant displays the QR Code in-store via a decal or through a terminal, and the Card
          Members use their smartphone to scan the QR Code.

          Paybilt Consumer-Presented QR Code (CPQR):
          Card Members generate a QR Code from their mobile wallet or banking app and the Merchant scans the QR Code as a form of payment.`,
